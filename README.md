# Welcome to Niflheim!

Niflheim is a challenging, hardcore, modded server that -requires- users to install the Niflheim modpack.

## Rules
- Niflheim players are expected to have joined the Dusk Discord Server and agree to obey all rules of the Dusk Discord server while playing in Niflheim as well.  These rules can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/683821803252219974/683825744249749523/771419546505969667)

## About Hardcore Vikings

Niflheim is a harsh and unforgiving world, and Odin cannot abide failures.  A viking's death will result in all items currently carried to be removed from the world, and all skill progress lost!  The character will once again be spawned at the World Spawn.  You've been warned. 

Discord user Fracticality has created the hardcore mod that enables this feature, if you like it, thank him.  If you have feedback, please let him know.
## Joining the Dusk Discord Server
New players who are not already part of the Dusk Discord server should join the server and use the Valheim channel to discuss, and the Niflheim voice channel.  The Server-Info channel will have up-to-date information. [Join here](https://discord.gg/dFbnbaFhRA)

# Niflheim 1.2 Gameplay Quick Guide
Below are some things you really should know before jumping into Valheim.  We've taken a lot of time to build upon the great work of this community to create a bespoke experience designed to challenge, and reward our players with new ways to play. Not everything that has changes will be listed here, but these are the important highlights.

## **Adventuring**
### **Hardcore Vikings**
  - The core feature of Niflheim!
    - Characters who die in Niflheim are sent back to the world spawn, not their beds.
    - All items carried are lost upon death, no tombstone is created.
    - All skills are reset to 0.
    - **You have been warned!**

### **Reworked Armor Sets**
  - Armor has been reworked to offer bonuses to suit different styles of play.
  - Each piece of armor (Helmet/Chest/Legs) offers a unique bonus effect that scales with the materials it has been reinforced by.
  - Having a full set of 3 pieces of the same type will grant an additional set bonus that completes the playstyle of that class of armor.
    - Set bonuses are displayed at the bottom of armors.
    - Different armor pieces that can count towards the set bonus are listed in grey.
    - Equipped items contributing towards the set bonus will be displayed in white.
  - Armor is designed to be able to scale all the way until the end of the game.
    - Armor can be "Uptiered" at a crafting table.
      - Uptiering requires the 'next' new material type first (Leather can be reinforced with bronze.)
      - Uptiering resets any upgrades (stars) added to the old piece of armor.
      - Uptiering improves armor, the piece bonus, and the set bonus.
      - An item must go through each tier of upgrade in sequence (Leather must be reinforced with bronze before it can be reinforced with Iron.)
  - Capes each provide a unique bonus and can be mixed and matched to suit your preferences without regard to the rest of your armor.
  - There might be some surprises...

### **Enchanted Items**
  - Magic Items and effect have been added to the game and can be found throught the world and crafted.
  - Magic Items come in 4 levels of rarity based upon their power.  Magic, Rare, Epic, and Legendary.
  - Magic components can be used to enchant items.
    - Enchanting requires you to discover and create an enchanter crafting augment for the Forge.
      - A forge augmented by an enchanter can sacrifice various items for enchanting materials.
      - Lower quality enchanting materials can be combined into higher quality ones.
      - Certain trophies will yield materials only obtainable by sacrificing them.

### **World Levels and Difficulty Scaling**
 - Monster difficulty now scales up to 5 star levels by default, but higher star levels are possible.
 - The difficulty of a region is based on a combination of the world level and the local sector level.
   - Difficulty is primarily determined by World Level.
     - World Level scales from 0 at the spawn point, to 5 for the outer reaches of the map.
     - World Level zones are indicated on the map as dashed circles with the level transition indicated at the bottom part of the circle.
       - These level indicators can be seen even without having revealed the area. 
       - The circles are only displayed when they are revealed.  
     - The Further from spawn you go once crossing a line the more difficult monsters will become.  
   - Difficulty is locally influenced by the sector level.
     - The sector level is displayed at the bottom of the minimap and always starts at 0 within a given area.
     - As more monsters in a sector are killed, the sector can "level up" and start producing harder monsters.
     - Sectors can go up to level 3.

   - Some creatures in the world can spawn with special enhancements changing their behaviors or abilities.

   - Some creatures are infused with elemental wrath.  
   - These infusions are indicated in their name panel, and can be spotted at a distance by a malicious haze around the creature.
   - Infused creatures bring elemental wrath to their attacks, and may have other surprises waiting for you.
   - While they offer a fair challenge, they should be considered a serious threat.
