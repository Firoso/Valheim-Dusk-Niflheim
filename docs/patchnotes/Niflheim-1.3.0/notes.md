## Changes: 

 ### Loot System Changes:
 We are having a blast with the epic loot system, but we feel that some aspects of the 1.2 version went against the spirit of Valheim.  Particularly, it felt like killing enemies for epic loot weapons and equipment quickly became -the way- to gear up, especially upon reaching the swamps.  We wanted players to instead experience this more in line with the survival crafting nature of Valheim.  So we've made the following changes.

 - New drop formulas are in place to make rarity distribution more broad across the spectrum.  Lower tier monsters such as Greydwarf Shamans, Brutes, and Trolls for instance still have a good chance of dropping epic and even legendary items if you can get their star levels up through world level or sector level scaling.
 - Weapon and Armor drops have been significantly reduced and down-scaled.  No more Christmas-Tree landscapes.
 - To compensate for the reduction in weapon and armor drops, most enemies will now have a chance of dropping some enchanting shards.  These stack up to 100, making them much easier to manage in your inventory while adventuring.
 - Converting Shards to Materials is now a little more complex.  In addition to the usual 2 shard, converting your hard earned shards to enchanting materials will require an additional catalyst.
   - For dust, you will require a particular trophy (greydwarf for magic tier)
   - For essences, you will require an abundant material (Bone fragments for magic tier)
   - For reagents will require a material that can be harvested or easily gathered through targetted farming of enemies (thistle for Magic Tier)
 - Additionally, Runstones may now be crafted through the application of magical components as well as a medium to infuse.  Example for magic tier is 2 Dust, 2 Reagents, 2 Essence, and 10 FineWood.
 - Trophies have been modified in their disenchanting results, making many of them more valuable to disenchant than to sell now.  Instead of simply giving shards, more than half of the trophies give more complex enchanting materials such as Reagents or Dust.
 - Many enemies had their drop tiers reassigned.  Most enemies in the swamp won't be dropping iron tier gear for you anymore for example.
 - Additionally, to incentivise players who have already farmed up a good deal of weapon and equipment loot to produce new enchanted equipment, we have increased the range of enchanted weapon affixes modestly.  It is now possible for Rare weapons to have 5 affixes, Epic to have 6, and Legendary to have 8.  The chances of these higher affix results is still very low, but getting 6 or more enchants on a Legendary is a 20% chance instead of the original 2%, so the odds are more in your favor than ever!

The hope for all these changes is to give players the opportunity to invest in their gear more intentionally, gathering enchanting materials as a part of the regular crafting system, and infuse their crafted gear with earned enchants rather than leaning on the loot pi√±ata to grant them gear.  We will continue to monitor this situation and make adjustments.

 ### Troll Armor Changes:
 - Troll armor is now themed around assasintation and cooperative play, exposing an enemy's weakness to allow others to exploit it.
 - Troll armor introduces a status effect called pinning that can be inflicted by the Troll armor set bonus.  When an enemy is pinned, it becomes weak to all damage types and elements.

 ### Vendor Updates:
  - Several items have had their costs adjusted.
  - Arrows are more expensive in particular, and now sell only in stacks of 100.
