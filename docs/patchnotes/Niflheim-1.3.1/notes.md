# Niflheim 1.3.1 patch notes

1.3.1 represents a midway effort to 1.4.0 and brings with it some tuning and fixes.

## Changes: 
 ### Monster Tuning:
  - Surtlings have had their damage reduced somewhat.
  - Bonemass is now a bit deadlier and a bit faster.

 ### Magic Enchantments Changes:
  - Retuned Elemental Resist to [5-8, 7-12, 9-15, 11-18] instead of [1-4, 3-8, 7-15, 15-20].  This prevents some situational invulnerability builds from being possible.
  - Bonus Carry Weight for Epic and Legendary boosted from [15-25, 20-50] to [15-40, 40-100].  This allows for more specialized equipment sets to be prioritized around heavy lifting.
  - Lifesteal has been improved from [0.8-1.4, 1.5-2.2, 2.3-3.0] to [1.4-2.2, 1.7-3.5, 2.5-5.0] representing roughly a 66% improvement.
  - Quickdraw enchant is not working due to a conflict with archery changes.  This has temporarily been removed until we can remedy this.
  - Featherfall can no longer spawn on plain Magic (blue) items.
  - The Movement Speed (Critical) enchantment has been significantly improved to grant heroic speed boosts when low health.
  - The Health Regen (Critical) enchantment has been improved slightly at low rarities and significantly at high rarities.
  - The Stamina Regen (Critical) enchantment has been improved slightly at low rarities and modestly at high rarities.
  - The Bonus Damage (Critical) enchantement has been improved modestly across the board.
  - The Life Steal (Critical) enchantment has been improved significantly across the board.
  - Executioner enchantments can now reach even higher values.
  - Duelist has been added to the game.  This allows for a player using only a 1h weapon to parry much more effectively without a shield.

 ### Loot System Changes:
  - New 5x crafting recipes for enchanting materials.  
  - New 20x crafting recipe for shards.
  - After a boss for a particular biome is slain, the finite resources obtained in that biome become available as regular drops from some creatures.  The drops are currently on the low side.  The drop rate and/or spawn rate will likely need some tweaks, so feel free to give feedback.

 ### Raids:
  - Several raids were changed to spawn under more appropriate circumstances.  This was already hot-fixed prior to the 1.3.1 Launch but is here for reference compared to 1.3.0 patch notes.
  - Raids should properly despawn after a fixed time if nobody is in the area now.

 ### Spawn Rules:
  - Several Monsters have seen their spawn rates tweaked or their spawn rules altered to create a more interesting and hopefully balanced experience.
  
 ### Vendor Updates:
  - Several items have had their costs adjusted.
  - Arrows are more expensive in particular, and now sell only in stacks of 100.

 ### New Miniboss:
  - The first of many new creatures currently planned in a series of minibosses, the Greydwarf Stormcaller has been added.
