# Niflheim 1.1.1 patch notes

## New Content:
 - Jams! As a thank you for putting up with the delay for this much needed fix, we've added new Jam types!  They're nothing too powerful or fancy, but we thought they would be fun.
 
## Changes: 
 ### Vendor Updates:
 - Coins now stack up to 99,999!
 - Gear prices across the board reworked
 - Vendor carries his normal inventory items once again (circlet, strength belt, fishing pole, etc.).
 - Trophies in particular are worth FAR more than they used to be.
 - Item prices related to the special store are fixed, shouldn't be as abusable.  They represent a 10% discount on enchanting materials
 - Vendor will once again take your produce, but won't ruin his credit doing so anymore.
 - Adventuring is Useful! Forest, Iron, and Gold tokens received from treasure maps and bounties are now an important part of the economy at all levels.
 - Gambling overhaul!
   - Gambling was far too cheap.  Should be much more in line with the intended vision.
   - Players are now encouraged to do treasure hunts and bounties in order to earn materials to get reliable gambling results for higher-quality results at a more affordable price.
   - Some Examples---

 ### Multiplayer Scaling:
 We want to encourage players playing in groups, without punishing solo play.  As of right now, we feel that groups have it too easy, but soloplay is more-or less about where we want it.  We also want to create situations where nearby players are encouraged to come to the aid of teammates even if they're not immediately present as we feel like this encourages friendly play and team-work.  To that end we have made the following changes.

 - Previously multiplayer scaling was set to 40% bonus health and 4% bonus attack per player in range.  This has been adjusted upward to 75% health and 7% attack.  
 - Players were previously considered "in-range" for terms of multiplayer scaling when they were at 200m (roughly a 25 second unencumbered run). We have scaled this up to 450m (roughly a second 45 unencumbered run.)  This should encourage some "oh crap, someone help" gameplay without it being a perverse incentive to lone-wolf.
    
We will monitor this, feel free to provide feedback on the difficulty changes around multiplayer scaling.
 
 ### Raid Events:
 We want these to not punish players near the spawn or in lower level zones much.  Furthermore we don't want it to ruin your day by forcing you off your scaffolding on your 16m tall highwire construction projects, making you just as likely to die to a mob as plummet to your death in panic.  This will take ongoing effort, but we still wanted to address this a little for now.

 - For now, raids don't scale in difficulty based on the world state.  They just are what they are.  This is likely to be changed in the future.  Feedback solicited.
 - Not all biomes get all raids.  Meadows bases should be safer for now...
 - Deathsquito and ghosts events are disabled. For now...

 ### Dungeons:
 We want exploring, foraging, and scavaging to be a core part of the game loop.  Finding a dungeon should be a huge opportunity and very exciting!  However, we want players to move on once they've cleared a dungeon and not linger.  We also want to make sure players are well rewarded for their efforts!  To that end we've made a few changes.

 - The vendor will buy valuables such as amber, rubies, and silver necklaces for far more than before.  This will increase the profit motive for finding them even late into the game, rather than making them rubbish not worth looting.  We are open to adjusting values going forward.
 
 - We currently have a 140 minute (7 day in game) dungeon contents respawn timer.  We think this is too low.  We are doubling it for now.  Additionally, monsters were set to respawn every 20 minutes in a dungeon, which could be a VERY painful fate if they spawn on top of you when you're un-prepared.  Furthermore, when far above the target level for a dungeon, they could very easily turn into farming status with the current settings.  We want you to move on and maybe come back later for more.  Monster spawns are ALSO being set to 280 minutes (14 days.)

 We are looking at ways to make Dungeons even more rewarding.  Finders keepers ;)

 ### Hardcore Death Messages:
  - Death messages will now try to be more representative of the means of death.  Thanks again to @Fracticality!

 ### Bug Fixes
  - Map pins were being impacted by the logic for the Hardcore mod.  This seems to have been fixed through some clever detective work.  Thanks @Fracticality!

## Final Words:

We want to thank you all for playing on Niflheim.  We plan to continue to learn from this experience and curate better games going forward.  We're aware that the challenge scaling isn't ideal right now, particularly the power ramp when you move to the mountains being a brutal jump.  We're discussing ways we can address this without simply nerfing the mountain biome.  We're open to your thoughts and feedback here.  

Additionally, we are still looking at some changes to gameplay, both big and small.  We expect 1.2 to have a good mix of changes and to continue to build on the work of previous changes.  We will keep you posted.  Thank you for helping make Niflheim a great server.
