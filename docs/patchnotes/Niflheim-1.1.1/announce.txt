Niflheim is being updated to version 1.1.1! You will need to update in order to connect to the server. See guidance about upgrading to 1.1.1 at https://github.com/Firoso/Valheim-Dusk-Niflheim/blob/main/docs/update-guidance/Niflheim-1.1.1/notes.md

  JAMS: 
  We have introduced more jams as a way of saying thank you to our players, just for fun!

  VENDOR CHANGES:
  Pretty big overhaul of costs, adventures, and gambling economics, as well as some exploit fixes.  See patch notes for details.

  MULTIPLAYER SCALING:
  Playing as a group is now more dangerous than before, but should still be much easier than going it alone if you are similarly geared and work together.

  RAIDS:
  Some initial efforts to tame the lower biome raids so new players won't get shut out of starter zones after boss kills.

  DUNGEONS:
  Dungeons respawn less frequently, but the loot you carry out should be worth quite a bit!

  MAPS: 
  Map pin bug should be fixed!
