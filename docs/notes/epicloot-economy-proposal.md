## Issues:
- Too many shards without enough uses.
- Dust feels kinda redundant.
- Disenchanting feels a bit weak given the current loot economy (low drop rates of items).
- Re-augs need to be revisited.
- Runestones feel weird.
- Enchanting access feels too late.

## Proposals:
- Make the enchanter into a workbench upgrade, uses 50 shards.
- Make enchanting weapons cost Shards + Essence + Runestone
- Make enchanting armor cost Shards + Essence + Runestone
- Trophies no longer sacrifice into shards.  Only Dust, Essence, Reagents, or in rare cases like bosses, into runestones.
- Epic loot drop rates reduced to give a flat 50% chance base-rate of no-drop.
- Runestone crafting is now more straight forward.  Shards + Dust + tier-locked material.  (Finewood, ElderBark, Crystal, BlackMetalScrap)
- Runestone up-tiering will now be 5 x Lower Tier Runestone + the tier-locked material. (ElderBark, Crystal, BlackMetalScrap)
- Legendary Enchanting will require a unique item per category, all of which will be Mountains biome or later materials.  Examples:
  - Bow - 1 x Needle
  - 1H Weapon - 1 x Wolf Fang
  - TwoHandedWeapon - 1 x Crystal
  - Tool - 1 x BlackMetalScrap
  - Torch - 1 x FreezeGland
  - Shield - 1 x Obsidian
  - Helmet - 1 x Drake Egg
  - Chest - 2 x Flax
  - Legs - 1 x SilverOre
  - Shoulder - 1 x Lox Hide
  - Utility - 1 x CloudBerry

## Discussions:
- Unclear what to do with re-augmentation, but using Dust/Shards/Tokens seems logical.
