General proposal:

- Split Raids (for management reasons) into Biomes
- Global minimum raid frequency 20minutes (1 day)
- Individually tune on World Levels, Raid Frequency, RaidChance, Day/Night, BaseOnly

Introduce and leverage some new monsters here, introducing new raids bit by bit as able.

Types of Raids:
- Ambush - Just exists to make things interesting.  Meant to mostly make things interesting.
- Champion - Offers a rare fight against a unique champion creature.
- Raiders - Attacks on a base, meant to harass, but would have difficulty breaching a base if left unchallenged.
- Seige - Attacks on a base, but meant to destroy defenses.
