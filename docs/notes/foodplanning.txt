Functions:
   - Building Defenses
     - HP - Falling Damage/Attrition due to distraction
     - Duration - It's easy to lose track of your hunger while building, long lasting food helps alleviate the food maintainance.
     - Endurance - used for recovering during building as well as short sprints moving around the site
   - Hunting
     - Stamina - For sneaking, long bow draws/multiple shots, melee combat, and running down deer.
     - HP/Tick - For quick recovery from any skirmishes.
     - Endurance - For quick recovery from sneaking, sprints, and bow fatigue
   - Gathering
     - Foraging - If gathering, you're going to be picking up raspberries and the like, and can probably just throw meat on the fire once in a while if you have the opportunity.  Keep slots free and carry weight low to gather more stuff.
     - Duration - Food should last you most of an outing or longer if you're gathering.
     - Stamina - Helps you get around and run from fights.

   - Raid Defense
     - HP - Surviving the onslaught.
     - Stamina - Fighting back.
     - HP/Tick - Fall back and recover inside your defenses, get back in the fight faster.
   - Exploration
     - Stamina - Got a long way to go, fording rivers, swimming in the sea, running up steep hills.  Stamina grants victory against these barriers.
     - Duration - Long trips require long-lasting food and slots/weight to spare for spoils.
     - HP - You never know what you'll run into out there, best to be prepared.

Priorities:
HP        3@***      2@*
Stamina   3@*** 1@** 1@*
HP/Tick         3@** 1@*
Duration        3@**
Endurance       1@** 2@*
Foraging  1@***

the basic idea is, 
I should be easily able to get 10*s in my top priority.
I should be able to get 12 or 13* if I want to REALLY push it
I should be able to get 8* in my 2nd preference
I should be able to get 6* in my 3rd preference
